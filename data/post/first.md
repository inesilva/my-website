category: tech
description: "When do we look for our **first job as software engineers** some questions might
pop up like - **How will my week look like?** **What will be the most
challenging parts?**

I was in this situation one year ago, and I want to tell you how it was my
onboarding into the professional world.

This post has in mind all the future junior software engineers."
